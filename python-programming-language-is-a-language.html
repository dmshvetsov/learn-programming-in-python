				<section>First of all<br><h1>Programming Language is a Language</h1></section>
				<section>
					Programming languages is a language to describe how we create, store, and change data.
				</section>
				<section>
					So with Programming Language such as Python we can create data, then store it for later use, and modify or change it.
				</section>
				<section>
					Not really useful explanation I guess.
				</section>
				<section>
					So lets start again. One step at a time. What is data?
				</section>
				<section>
					<div>The simplest data are:</div>
					<ul>
						<li>numbers</li>
						<li>strings</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Strings</h2>
					<pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers>
						"this is a python string"
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					Note the number <code>1</code> on the right side of the example bellow
					<pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers>
						&nbsp;
					</code></pre>
					<p>This is a line number. Python programming language are written line by line. Like a lyrics.</p>
					<p>Each line represent single instruction, an action, a step that intend to create, or sore, or change piece of data.</p>
					<p>That is why programmers are saying that they read or write programs line by line.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					But lets get back to our data examples, <code>strings</code> and <code>numbers</code>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Numbers</h2>
					<pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers>
1
2020
1.61803398875
						</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<code>1</code> is a number. A really basic number.
				</section>
				<section>
					<code>2020</code> it is a year when this slides are made. And it is a number.
				</section>
				<section>
					And <code>1.61803398875</code> it is a number as well. And this number represent an interesting number the golden ratio.
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>A string <code>"it is a python string"</code> and a number <code>2020</code> it is a data.</p>
					<p>A data that represent a string with characters and number of a year that we can create in Python.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>When we type a string or a number like this:</p>
					<pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers>
						"this is a python string"
						2020
					</code></pre>
					<p>we are creating data.</p>
					<p>When I saying type a mean we type text in the text editor like Google Docs or Microsoft Word but better.</p>
					<p>Line by line and creating instruction in a programming language.</p>
					<p>This instructions will be executed by a computer, its central processed unit or CPU. CPU is a pretty cool thing by the way!</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>There are much more types of data but lets concentrate on strings and numbers.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>No we have understanding what data is. How we can store it in a program language such as Python?</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>We can store data in computer memory.</p>
					<p>To do so we can use a line with an instruction like bellow:</p>
					<pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers>
						a_string_variable = "this is a python string"
						a_year_variable = 2020
					</code></pre>
					<p>Here on the first line we store string data and on the line 2 store a number data.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>We store this data in a computer memory and need something to refer to it.</p>
					<p>On the left side of <code>=</code> sign we have a name:</p>
					<pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers>
						a_string_variable = "this is a python string"
						a_year_variable = 2020
					</code></pre>
					<p><code>a_string_variable</code> it is a name that points to the string in the memory
					and <code>a_year_variable</code> it is a name that points to the number in the memory.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Variables</h2>
					<p>Name that points into a piece of data in the computer memory called variables.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Often in programming thing are called after a meaning.</p>
					<p>Variable are good example of it. It is called this way because they are used to store variable data and can change over time in Python.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>Here variable <code>piece_of_data</code> store 4 different values:</p>
					<pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers>
						piece_of_data = "abra"
						piece_of_data = "cadabra"
						piece_of_data = 37
						piece_of_data = 0
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>On each line we <em>assign</em> different data to a variable.</p>
					<p>First, two stings on line 1 and 2.</p>
					<p>Then, two numbers on line 2 and 3.</p>
					<pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers="1-2|3-4">
						piece_of_data = "abra"
						piece_of_data = "cadabra"
						piece_of_data = 37
						piece_of_data = 0
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>On each line, the state of the computer's memory and as a result of our 4 lines program changes.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>On line 1 our program stores string <code>"abra"</code></p>
					<pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers="1">
						piece_of_data = "abra"
						piece_of_data = "cadabra"
						piece_of_data = 37
						piece_of_data = 0
					</code></pre>
					How variable pointing (or referring) to data in the memory:
					<pre><code data-trim>
["abra"]
 ^
 piece_of_data
					</code></pre>
					<p><code>[]</code> characters represents the computer memory and what inside of it.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>On line 2 our program stores string <code>"cadabra"</code></p>
					<pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers="2">
						piece_of_data = "abra"
						piece_of_data = "cadabra"
						piece_of_data = 37
						piece_of_data = 0
					</code></pre>
					How variable pointing (or referring) to data in the memory:
					<pre><code data-trim>
["abra", "cadabra"]
          ^
          piece_of_data
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>On line 3 our program stores number <code>37</code></p>
					<pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers="3">
						piece_of_data = "abra"
						piece_of_data = "cadabra"
						piece_of_data = 37
						piece_of_data = 0
					</code></pre>
					How variable pointing (or referring) to data in the memory:
					<pre><code data-trim>
["abra", "cadabra", 37]
                    ^
                    piece_of_data
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>On line 4 our program stores number <code>0</code></p>
					<pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers="4">
						piece_of_data = "abra"
						piece_of_data = "cadabra"
						piece_of_data = 37
						piece_of_data = 0
					</code></pre>
					How variable pointing (or referring) to data in the memory:
					<pre><code data-trim>
["abra", "cadabra", 37, 0]
                        ^
                        piece_of_data
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>At the end of our 4 line program we in the memory have all 4 data that we created and <code>piece_of_data</code> variable points to the last data that we created – number <code>0</code></p>
					<pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers="4">
						piece_of_data = "abra"
						piece_of_data = "cadabra"
						piece_of_data = 37
						piece_of_data = 0
					</code></pre>
					How variable pointing (or referring) to data in the memory:
					<pre><code data-trim>
["abra", "cadabra", 37, 0]
                        ^
                        piece_of_data
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>At the end of the program we have access to <code>0</code>. This means that we can refer only to the data that we stored in a named variable.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>If we add another line with another <code>0</code> at line 5 to our program this will create another <code>0</code> to the memory:</p>
					<pre><code data-trim data-line-numbers="5">
						piece_of_data = "abra"
						piece_of_data = "cadabra"
						piece_of_data = 37
						piece_of_data = 0
						piece_of_data = 0
					</code></pre>
					How variable pointing (or referring) to data in the memory:
					<pre><code data-trim>
["abra", "cadabra", 37, 0, 0]
                           ^
                           piece_of_data
					</code></pre>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>This is how we can store data in programs. What about to modify them.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					Python has 35 special words:
					<br>
					<code>
						False      await      else       import     pass
						None       break      except     in         raise
						True       class      finally    is         return
						and        continue   for        lambda     try
						as         def        from       nonlocal   while
						assert     del        global     not        with
						async      elif       if         or         yield	
					</code>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						Special words in programming called <em>Keywords</em>.
					</section>
					<section>
						Keywords has a special meaning in programming languages.
						When they are used they produce some definite actions.
						Let's take a look.
